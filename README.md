# APT-Ahead-Trajectory-Predictor-

In this study, we propose Ahead Trajectory Predictor (ATP), a trajectory prediction system utilizing YOLOv8-based vehicle detection and Temporal Graph Attention Network (TGAT). ATP consists of a Tracking Optimizer (TO), which is robust to illumination and environmental changes, and a TGAT, which learns graph and time series information. Experimental results show that ATP outperforms existing methods in terms of MAE, RMSE, ADE, and FDE metrics, and is capable of accurate trajectory prediction even in a single-camera environment. This research can be utilized in real-time in autonomous driving and traffic control systems and is expected to contribute to the realization of a safe and efficient driving environment.
